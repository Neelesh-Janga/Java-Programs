# Chocolate Distribution Problem
<p>Given an array of N integers where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that:</p>
<ul><li>Each student gets one packet.</li>
<li>The difference between the number of chocolates in the packet with maximum chocolates and the packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.</li></ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Input :</strong> arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}&nbsp;, m = 3&nbsp;<br><strong>Output:</strong> Minimum Difference is 2&nbsp;<br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>We have seven packets of chocolates and&nbsp;we need to pick three packets for 3 students&nbsp;<br>If we pick 2, 3 and 4, we get the minimum&nbsp;difference between maximum and minimum packet&nbsp;sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Input :</strong> arr[] = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12}&nbsp;, m = 5&nbsp;<br><strong>Output:</strong> Minimum Difference is 6&nbsp;</p><div style="text-align:center;"></div>
<p><strong>Input :</strong> arr[] = {12, 4, 7, 9, 2, 23, 25, 41,&nbsp;30, 40, 28, 42, 30, 44, 48,&nbsp;43, 50}&nbsp;, m = 7&nbsp;<br><strong>Output:</strong> Minimum Difference is 10&nbsp;</p>
